Senior Engineer Collins of Second Rotation
Subject: Mining Equipment

God, get your punctuation and gramma right! I didn't take four of english to look at this [REDACTED] mess--
Unbelievable, this is a cut and fill mining operation and those guys in MD seem to think it's a blast operation. This is the third excractor we’ve fixed up in 2 months. Bad enough we’re fixing equipment meant to last for years, this shearer we’ve just received looks like they’ve been using old parts of the station walls as a patch job. God knows what it’s looking like down there, but it's only going to get worse. Apparently, MD has found something valuable and Communications have told them to go fetch. Hence, they’re doing overtime to get whatever shiny trinket they’ve found and we’re going to be doing overtime as mining can’t seem to stop destroying their [REDACTED] equipment. God, what I’d give for my rotation to be over already. God I wish I was dead.
