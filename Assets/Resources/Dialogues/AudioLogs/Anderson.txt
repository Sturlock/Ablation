Security Anderson of Second Rotation
Subject: A.I. Malfunction

I think the guys in comms are messin with SHAWN up there. I dunno, it's just, SHAWN’s been preachin about someone that's not meant to be down in engineerin, but I’ve been askin around and everyone’s where they should be. I even checked the life trackers and I ain't seen nothin. So either SHAWNs finally lost it or they’ve been tampered with by comms or RD. Gonna have to report it anyway. Phil out.
