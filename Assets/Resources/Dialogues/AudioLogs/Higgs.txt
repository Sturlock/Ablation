Senior Engineer Higgs of Second Rotation
Subject: Communication Complaint (Again)

It's not fair! It’s Christmas tomorrow and we’re still not allowed to relax and, you know, enjoy ourselves. Ashley went above and beyond this year and managed to smuggle in some Moonshine whiskey. Not to say last year wasn’t great and all, Ashley got a bunch of streamers in by pretending they were vital and extremely delicate wires used for fixing up one of the de-freezing agents of the COMA pods; that was fun until communication came down and “appropriated” them. And they’ve done it again, this time before we even got a chance to drink. I hope  Ashleys alright, I haven't seen them in a couple of days. . . . SHAWN is such a snitch. It wouldn’t have been a problem if Allen was actually in charge, I think he was looking forward to us drinking as well. It would have been nice to get a drink for a change, oh well, Merry Christmas I suppose.
