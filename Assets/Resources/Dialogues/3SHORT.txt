<time/>006.281|<b>Harold:</b> I'm guessing you're Allen. Hey, th-there was blood back there.
<time/>012.059|<b>Allen:</b> Aye. Somethin' arrived on this side of the station, I don't know where from, but the bloody thing has been attacking anything that makes more than a peep.
<time/>021.201|<b>Allen:</b> What's worse, its blooming well got to the life support and backup generators. I need you to go down to engineering and fix it. Quickly.
