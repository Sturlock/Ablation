<time/>000.010|<b>Allen:</b> You're a right bleeding tube, aren't ya? Ruddy stations going up in smokes and you're just taking your blinking time. 
<time/>006.599|<b>Harold:</b> I'm guessing. . .you're Allen.
<time/>008.800|<b>Allen:</b> And it looks like the COMA pods haven't messed you up too silly like.
<time/>012.948|<b>Allen:</b> You can't see me right now cause circumstances have arrived that mean <b>I</b> ain't opening that door.
<time/>018.414|<break/>
<time/>019.079|<b>Allen:</b> What I need, however, is a pair of arms and legs that can <i>fix</i> this place before it all goes belly up.
<time/>027.467|<b>Harold:</b> Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realise I was late for your little <i>saftey</i> briefing. I just got dragged out of icy imprisonment, I think I'm allowed to take my time here.
<time/>035.392|<break/>
<time/>036.342|<b>Harold:</b> . . . Hey, there was blood back there. . .
<time/>039.350|<b>Allen:</b> Aye. Somethin's arrived on this side of the station, I don't know where from, but the bloody thing has been attacking <b>anything</b> that makes more than a peep.
<time/>048.475|<b>Allen:</b> What's worse, it's blooming well got to the life support and backup generators.
<time/>052.777|<b>Allen:</b> I need you to go down, to engineering, and fix it, quickly. 
<time/>056.264|<break/>
<time/>057.035|<b>Allen:</b> Or, every living soul on this station, is going to not be, in about an hour.
<time/>061.587|<b>Harold:</b> <i>Great!</i>
<time/>062.545|<b>Harold:</b> Could you have woke someone more capable and let me sleep though my inevitable demise?
<time/>067.554|<break/>
<time/>068.204|<b>Allen:</b> Oi! You're capable enough, besides, I could override one COMA pod.
<time/>074.499|<b>Allen:</b> Look, if you keep heading this direction, you should find the elevator. There's a map by the door, go down and I'll direct you through it.
<time/>082.902|<b>Allen:</b> Being in control of the maintance district does have it's perks.
<time/>087.385|<b>Harold:</b> Elevator. Engineering. Map. Got it.
<time/>090.335|<b>Allen:</b> Ah, hold on, laddie. . . I forgot to mention one thing. . .
<time/>095.064|<b>Harold:</b> Please be that this is a bad dream? 
<time/>096.922|<break/>
<time/>097.658|<b>Allen:</b> Well, funny you mentioned bad, cause before Phil, one of security, got caught by that thing. He triggered lockdown. Which trapped it. . . On this floor.
<time/>109.598|<b>Harold:</b> You mean the floor <b>I'm</b> on is currently the floor <b>it's</b> on. . . Oh, yeah. Not traumatic at all.  
<time/>116.350|<break/>
<time/>117.158|<b>Allen:</b> Looky here eejit, the elevator is through there and so is our only way to save your hide and anyone else thats still alive. As long as you're quiet it. Should. Be. Good.
<time/>129.355|<b>Allen:</b> I've hooked myself up to your handyman by the way, if you need my advice, call me. 
<time/>134.271|<b>Allen:</b> Good luck kid.
<time/>135.100|<break/>
<time/>135.915|<b>Harold:</b> You've got to be kidding me, that's it? . . . Okay. . . Elevator. Engineering. Avoid deadly creature that will attack if I breath loud enough.
<time/>144.547|<break/>
<time/>145.683|<b>Harold:</b> You've got this.
